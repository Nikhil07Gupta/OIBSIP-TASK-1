                    <p>The Victoria Memorial Hall is one of the most magnificent monuments of not only the city of
                        Calcutta
                        but
                        of
                        our entire country.Representing the resplendent and majestic British architecture, Victoria
                        Memorial
                        Hall
                        stands today, as a veritable icon of the city of Kolkata. Located on 1 Queen’s way, the VMH was
                        envisaged by
                        Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of British India, as a memorial to the deceased Queen Victoria. Hence,
                        according to
                        Curzon this memorial should take form of a great marble hall, which was to be erected on the
                        Calcutta
                        maidan
                        to serve primarily as a monument to the Queen and secondarily as a national gallery in India.

                                for its artistic

                                Amer Palace is great example of Rajput architecture. Some of its buildings and work have
                                influence of
                                Mughal

                                    <p>The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur, India. Built from red and pink
                                        sandstone, it is on
                                        the
                                        edge
                                        of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers.

                                        The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of
                                        Maharaja Sawai Jai
                                        Singh,
                                        the founder of the city of Jhunjhunu in the state of Rajasthan.[1] He was so
                                        inspired by the unique
                                        structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace.

                                        It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior is akin to a
                                        honeycomb with its 953
                                        small
                                        windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework.[2] The original
                                        intent of the lattice
                                        design
                                        was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in
                                        the street below
                                        without
                                        being seen. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi
                                        effect to pass
                                        through,
                                        thus
                                        making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in
                                        summer.[2][3][4] Many people see
                                        the
                                        Hawa Mahal from the street view and think it is the front of the palace, but it
                                        is the back.</p>

                                    <p>The India Gate (formerly known as All India War Memorial) is a war memorial
                                        located near the Kartavya
                                        path on
                                        the eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi, formerly called Rajpath.
                                        It stands as a memorial
                                        to
                                        84,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who died between 1914 and 1921 in the
                                        First World War, in
                                        France,
                                        Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near
                                        and the Far East, and
                                        the
                                        Third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including some soldiers and
                                        officers from the United
                                        Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate.[2] Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate
                                        evokes the architectural
                                        style of the memorial arch such as the Arch of Constantine, in Rome, and is
                                        often compared to the Arc de
                                        Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai.</p>
